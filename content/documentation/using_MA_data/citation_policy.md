MetaLab allows researchers to use data available on its website. This
can be by citing meta-analytic results, or downloading dataset and
conducting custom analyses. In both cases our citation policy is the
following:

Researchers publishing or presenting work using data in MetaLab must
cite the publications linked to that dataset, as listed in the
Documentation. (If there is no citation, then no citation for the
individual dataset is necessary).

For tracking use of MetaLab, please also cite at least one of the
following: 

**Bergmann, C., Tsuji, S., Piccinini, P.E., Lewis, M.L., Braginsky, M.,
Frank, M.C., & Cristia, A. (2018).** Promoting replicability in
developmental research through meta-analyses: Insights from language
acquisition research. Child Development, 89, 1996-2009 . DOI:
10.1111/cdev.13079 [Repository]

**Lewis, M. L., Braginsky, M., Tsuji, S., Bergmann, C., Piccinini,
P. E., Cristia, A., & Frank, M. C. (2017/under review).** A Quantitative
Synthesis of Early Language Acquisition Using Meta-Analysis. DOI:
10.17605/OSF.IO/HTSJM [Preprint]

If researchers use more than five datasets, we ask users as a courtesy
to cite all data. But in case of severe space limitations, the
database as a whole alone may be cited.

Since the MetaLab site is dynamic, we recommend that you list the date
of download for your data in your manuscript. For example: “We analyze
all data currently in MetaLab (Bergmann et al., 2017). Data were
downloaded on 06/17/17.”
